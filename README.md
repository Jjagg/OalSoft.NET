# OalSoft.NET

A thin managed wrapper for [OpenAL soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft).
Uses [OpenAL#](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/OpenAL-CS) for the bindings.

I implemented just enough to fit my needs (might grow in the future), but feel free to send a PR if you want to use it and lack some functionality.
